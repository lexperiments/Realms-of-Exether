  # Religion Flavor
  religion_flavor_loc_default: ""
  church_of_man_flavor: "The Church of Man originated as an organized form of the various native beliefs of humans in [concept_noricum], incorporating the most worshipped deities and traditions on the continent into a united faith. Since then, the Church of Man has spread through the Dumonian conquests of [concept_zalaron], occasionally integrating new foreign gods into the pantheon."
  wild_seldarine_flavor: "All elves used to follow the same gods of the Seldarine, but the fracturing of elven society has created multiple branches of the faith that disagree about the interpretations of their gods. The wood elves spent centuries isolated from civilization and their kin, and the nature-focused gods of the seldarine, such as Rillifane, have supplanted the likes of Corellon and Angharradh in importance. The wild seldarine emphasizes harmony with nature and living off the land, eschewing arcane magic."
  southern_seldarine_flavor: "All elves used to follow the same gods of the Seldarine, but the fracturing of elven society has created multiple branches of the faith that disagree about the interpretations of their gods. The drow elves come from a matriarchal society, and reflect this in their religious views. The Southern Seldarine brings the female gods to prominence, especially Corellon's first wife, Araushnee, who serves as the head of the pantheon."
  orthodox_seldarine_flavor: "All elves used to follow the same gods of the Seldarine, but the fracturing of elven society has created multiple branches of the faith that disagree about the interpretations of their gods. The High elves and some half-elves of [concept_zalaron] follow what is known as the Orthodox Seldarine, which puts particular importance on magic and arts in order to emulate the chief deity Corellon."
  morndinsamman_flavor: "Dwarven religion is based on the veneration of ancestors. Dwarves deem any ancestor of their clan to be worthy of worship, but especially heroic figures can earn the admiration all dwarves irregardles of clan ties. The dwarven faith has changed the least of any religion since the Age of Gods. The dwarves that spent almost a millenium inside their vaults kept praciticing all of their old rites upon waking up. The only significant addition has been the appearance of [GetGoods('cloudsilver').GetName], which dwarves believe contain a manifestation of ancestor spirits."
  hasal_flavor: "The Creed of Hasal is a grim faith, founded by Hasal Nezzelech, a gnome that fought humanity with the powers of necromancy. It asserts that death is oblivion, that the universe is uncaring, and that if the gods exist, they are cruel. Its followers study the secrets of blood and life, and because they believe that death is the end, they see nothing wrong with using the bodies of the fallen to serve the living."
  house_of_fate_flavor: "According to the House of Fate, it is not gods that dictate the lives of mortals but fate itself. For every life upon Exether, there is a beautiful story to be told; but it is rarely allowed to unfold. The faith has become notorious for its extravagant rites as gambling has become a core institution of the religion. Since gleaning your true destiny can only be done in moments of pure chance, House of Fate ministers have come to host games of chance as a method of prosyletizing."
