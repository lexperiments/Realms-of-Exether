newspaper_superevent.1.f: "This is a template Superevent. It does not provide any content, but gives you an idea on how it is supposed to look like. Feel free to use this in order to add your own superevents to the mod. Have fun! I will add a little bit more text in order to show how much flavor we could pack in here. It could really provide a nice story. Are you still reading this? You can stop now. There is nothing more interesting coming here."
