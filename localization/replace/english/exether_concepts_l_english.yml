They guided civilizations, overseeing the construction of temples and raising palaces out of the mud.\nA few gods were kind to their followers, while others commanded faith through fear or violence. Every step of mortal life was at the whims of a deity to whom the [concept_material_plane] was a game. The gods had collectively created the world to prove who was superior, with each one convinced that mortals would worship them above all others.\nBut the gods were in for a rude awakening as mortal worship is fickle. Some were hated for their twisted ideals, while others lost their following when the people of Exether picked new favorites.

  concept_creation_of_exether: "Creation of Exether"

There they met other gods, some of whom were open to cooperation while others attempted conquests. The planes went through a period of epic conflicts, alliances, and plots for dominance of existence, but every invasion failed, every coalition fell apart, and every scheme fizzled out. The planes rejected foreign gods, and fate upheld the status quo no matter what. Realizing the futility of their actions, the gods gathered and came up with a compromise: they would create a new [concept_material_plane] where they could all vie for dominance, a world with nothing set in stone. Thus began the [concept_age_of_gods]."
