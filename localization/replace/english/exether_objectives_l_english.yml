  objective_settler_coast_desc: "Magic and gods are new and world-changing concepts to the people of Exether. In some places, it has given rise to new religions or a return to ancient traditions, but in others, it has become the focus of intense scientific study. \n \nWill the old kingdoms of the Settler Coast adapt and sail on the winds of change, or will magic be their undoing?"
  objective_settler_coast_name_ARR: "Union of Arrador"
  objective_settler_coast_desc_ARR: "The states that now make up the Union of Arrador achieved independence from the Dumonian Empire during the Nightfall, a period of magical calamities following the destruction of The Kingdom of Khus. \n \nOfficially, a monarch rules over the union, but their power pales next to the Astral Consortium, a cabal of wealthy industry titans. \n \nRapid technological progress has shifted culture within Arrador away from old Dumonian traditions and religion in favor of industry and innovation."
  objective_settler_coast_name_DUM: "Empire of Dumonia"
  objective_settler_coast_desc_DUM: "The Dumonian Empire is an old, revanchist state that has endured decades of decline. \n\nUnder emperor Urik Romhaar it was a united front for humanity, but war with the old Kingdom of Khus, and subsequent violent return of magic to the world has left it fracturedand weakened.  \n \nLosing influence along the Settler Coast, the new emperor has instead turned his attention to the faraway continent of Locari as a new avenue of expansion. \n \nRising instability allows increasingly extreme factions, such as the zealous Order of Amaunator, to vie for political dominance, threatening to reshape or unmake the old empire."
  objective_settler_coast_name_VOZ: "Vozmead Peaks"
  objective_settler_coast_desc_VOZ: "The skyhold of house Vozmead is the largest and most prosperous of the dwarven skyholds in Zalaron. The dwarves have settled on the peaks of the Wyrmspire mountain range and have built intricate structures into the cliffs and rock faces. \n \nThey have harnessed the power of Cloudsilver to create magnificent airships, which are essential for trade and transportation across the continent, earning them significant clout in international dealings. \n\nWith limited land to farm on the mountainside, they have developed a system of irrigated terraces that use glacier water to grow crops and provide a reliable source of water that is otherwise scarce in the region. These mountain farms have become an essential source of food for both the dwarves themselves and the surrounding drow settlements."
  objective_settler_coast_name_AHO: "Achon"
  objective_settler_coast_desc_AHO: "In the northeast of Zalaron, the nation of Achon, once a shining beacon of magical innovation and prosperity, now remains only as a shadow of its former self. The Nightfall ravaged the land, leaving it scarred and twisted. \n\nDespite the devastation, the people of Achon have persisted, rebuilding what they can in the wake of the cataclysm. But their efforts are hampered by a growing paranoia that has gripped the nation. The cataclysm was accompanied by a surge in the number of changelings and mimics, shapeshifters who can take on the form of any creature they encounter.\n\nThe people of Achon are now constantly on edge, never sure who they can trust. The government has enacted strict measures to root out changelings and mimics, with many living in fear of being accused of being a shapeshifter."
