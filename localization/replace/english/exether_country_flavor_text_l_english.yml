  DUM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Empire of Dumonia is a land of ancient traditions and fading glory, once the center of human power before the rise of magic brought it crashing down. The Nightfall led to the collapse of most of the empire, and today only the heartlands on Noricum remain under imperial control. Dumonia is a shadow of its former self and lags behind in the technological advancements that have swept other nations. \n\nBut the young emperor of the Romhaar family, eager to restore the empire's former glory, has sought to chart a new path for Dumonia. He has turned his sights towards the southeastern continent of Locari, a vast and untamed wilderness filled with new wonders and untold riches waiting to be claimed. \n\nWith his support, a new wave of Dumonian colonizers has set out to tame the wilds of Locari under the leadership of the South Seas Company, building new settlements and bringing with them the promise of progress and prosperity. But their presence has not gone unopposed, and the colonizers must constantly struggle against the fierce resistance of the indigenous peoples who call Locari home. \n\nMeanwhile, a new force has arisen in the empire: the fanatical Order of Amaunator. This religious organization worships the god of the sun and has gained a powerful following among the Dumonian people. The Order's zealotry has fueled a renewed sense of pride and purpose in the empire, but also a dangerous streak of fanaticism and intolerance. \n\nAs the empire struggles to find its place in a changing world, tensions simmer and threats loom on all sides. But one thing is clear: the fate of Dumonia hangs in the balance, and only bold and visionary leadership will be able to guide it through the challenges ahead."
